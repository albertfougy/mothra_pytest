Welcome to the mothra wiki!

The main objective of **Project Mothra** is to create an inventory of the technology products used by schools in order to identify common leverage points, places to collaborate, and shared pain points to tackle. 

Project Mothra has three main components: 
1. curation of programs in use
1. curation of key performance indicators in use
1. creation of a repository
